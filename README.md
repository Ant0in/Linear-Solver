# Linear Solver for Linear Systems

## Description

This repository contains a **linear solver** based on **triangulation methods** designed to solve linear systems efficiently. The project was developed as part of the **Calcul Formel et Num√©rique** course INFO-F205 and applies **triangulation techniques** to optimize the resolution of linear equations systems. The goal is to systematically reduce a system to an upper triangular form and solve it using back substitution.

## Usage

Make sure you have **Python 3.X** installed.


### Running the Solver

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ant0in/Linear-Solver-main.git
   ```

2. Run the solver:

   ```bash
   python ./main.py
   ```
